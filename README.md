# Exercise Application

## Description

This is a Java console application based on Spring Boot that allows users to manage and execute programming exercises. Users can select, add, and run exercises through a console interface. Each exercise is implemented as a separate class that implements the `Exercise` interface.

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle 6.8 or higher
- Spring Boot 2.5.4 or higher

## Usage

When you run the application, you will see the following menu in the console:

Select an option:
0 - Run an exercise
1 - Add a new exercise
2 - Exit

### Running an Exercise

1. Select option `0`.
2. Enter the number of the exercise you want to run.

### Adding a New Exercise

1. Select option `1`.
2. The application will create a new Java class in the `com.example.exercises.exercises` package with an incremental exercise number.
3. Implement the logic for the new exercise in the generated class.
